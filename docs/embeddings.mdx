An embedding is a vector that represents a piece of text, with the distance between vectors indicating similarity, which means closer distances mean more similar texts, while farther distances mean less similar texts.
:::note
The Cortex Embeddings feature is fully compatible with OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem  value="CLI" label="CLI" default>

    ```bash 
    # Without Flag
    cortex embeddings "Hello World"
    # With model_id Flag
    cortex embeddings [options] [model_id] "Hello World"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="CURL" label="CURL">
  #### **Request**
  To generate an embedding, send a text string and the embedding model name **(e.g., 'nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16')** to the Embeddings API endpoint.
  The Cortex-cpp server will return a list of floating-point numbers, which can be stored in a vector database for later use.
  ```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3928/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Your text string goes here",
    "model": "nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16",
    "stream": false
 }'


  ```
  #### **Endpoint Response**
  Below are examples of the embedding endpoint response from the Cortex server:
  ```bash

## Capabilities
### Batch Embeddings
Cortex's Embedding feature, powered by the [`cortex.llamacpp`](/docs/cortex-llamacpp) engine, offers an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. It supports processing multiple input data prompts simultaneously for batch embeddings.
### Pre-configured Models
We provide a selection of pre-configured models designed to integrate seamlessly with embedding features. These optimized models include:
- Mistral Instruct 7B Q4
- Llama 3 8B Q4
- Aya 23 8B Q4
