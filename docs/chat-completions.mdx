:::warning
🚧 Cortex is under construction.
:::

Cortex's Chat API is compatible with OpenAI’s [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) endpoint. It is a drop-in replacement for local inference.

For local inference, Cortex is [multi-engine](#multiple-local-engines) and supports the following model formats:

- `GGUF`: A generalizable LLM format that runs across CPUs and GPUs. Cortex implements a GGUF runtime through [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/).
- `TensorRT`: A production-ready, enterprise-grade LLM format optimized for fast inference on NVIDIA GPUs. Cortex implements a TensorRT runtime through [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM).

Cortex routes requests to multiple APIs for remote inference while providing a single, easy-to-use, OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem  value="CLI" label="CLI" default>
    ```bash 
    # Streaming 
    cortex chat --model janhq/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="CURL" label="CURL">
  ### Single Request Example
  To send a single query to your chosen LLM, use the following in your request:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:1337/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello"
      },
    ],
    "model": "",
    "stream": true,
    "max_tokens": 1,
    "stop": [
        null
    ],
    "frequency_penalty": 1,
    "presence_penalty": 1,
    "temperature": 1,
    "top_p": 1
  }'

  ```
  ### Dialog Request Example
  For ongoing conversations or multiple queries, structure a multi-turn conversation as follows:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:1337/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Where was it played?"
      }
    ],
    "model": "",
    "stream": true,
    "max_tokens": 1,
    "stop": [
        null
    ],
    "frequency_penalty": 1,
    "presence_penalty": 1,
    "temperature": 1,
    "top_p": 1
  }'

  ```
  ### Endpoint Response
  Below are examples of the chat completions endpoint response from the Cortex server:
  ```bash
  {
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "content": "Hello, how may I assist you this evening?",
        "role": "assistant"
      }
    }
  ],
  "created": 1700215278,
  "id": "sofpJrnBGUnchO8QhA0s",
  "model": "_",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "system_fingerprint": "_",
  "usage": {
    "completion_tokens": 13,
    "prompt_tokens": 90,
    "total_tokens": 103
  }
}
  ```

## Capabilities

### Multiple Local Engines

Cortex scales applications from prototype to production, running on CPU-only laptops with llama.cpp and GPU-accelerated with TensorRT-LLM.

To configure each engine, refer to:

- Use llama.cpp
- Use tensorrt-llm

Learn more about our engine architecture:

- cortex.cpp
- [cortex.llamacpp](/docs/cortex-llamacpp)
- cortex.tensorRTLLM

### Multiple Remote APIs

Cortex also acts as an aggregator for remote inference requests from a single endpoint. Currently, Cortex supports:

- OpenAI
- Groq
- Cohere
- Anthropic
- MistralAI
- Martian
- OpenRouter
